# Boston-Airbnb-Analysis


## Motivation

This entire project is part of a Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The project aimes to apply CRISP-DM process in analytics of data of my choice. I have chosen the Boston Airbnb Data. Using this data I have tried to answer the following questions:

What are the most popular neighbourhoods in Boston?
What are the common Price Listings of AirBnbs in Boston?
What are the Top Amenities that visitors look for?

## Dataset:
Kaggle Boston AirBnb data https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston. The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## File Descriptions
There is one Jupyter Notebook file that contains all the analytics and codes. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
